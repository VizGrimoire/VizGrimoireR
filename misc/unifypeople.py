#
# This is just a first try at a code for "unifying" uids in the people
# table created by CVSAnalY. It creates two tables:  people_upeople, which has
# people_id (id in people) and upeople_id, same id if unique, or "cannonical" id if
# duplicated. Cannonical id is considered to be the lower id in people.
# The second table is upeople which is a list of that "cannonical" ids.
#
# Most of the work is actually done by the Identities class, which is
# designed to store a kind of identities (names, email addresses, etc.)
# It offers several different methods for finding duplicate identities
# of that kind
